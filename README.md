# Do-it-Yourself Namespaces

This project serves multiple purposes:
* Learn to bring up a container from scratch using standard binaries (e.g. `unshare`).
* Get better at writing Python.
  * The original version of this project is written in Bash. Although it does its job, the reality
  is I would like to get more hands on with Python (or really any other language).
* At some point, I would like to transition from simple shell calls into making syscalls.
